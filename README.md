# Circuit-Workout-Companion
**Circuit Workout Companion** is a minimalist, single-page web application designed to guide users through precise circuit training routines. It features a clean split-screen UI that dynamically switches between high-visibility countdown timers and manual rep counters based on the exercise type. The app strictly enforces true circuit logic and includes automated rest periods, providing a focused, distraction-free companion for structured workouts.

## 🛠️ How This Project Was Created: An Iterative Workflow

This project was developed through a unique, iterative, and multi-tool workflow that combined structured planning, AI-assisted development, and progressive UI refinement.

### 1. Planning & Logic Design (ChatGPT)
The core workout routine and circuit logic were initially defined here. The focus was on creating a safe and structured plan that:
* Enforced **true circuit behavior** (complete all exercises before repeating the round).
* Correctly separated **timed** and **rep-based** exercises.
* Defined explicit **rest periods** between major circuits.

### 2. Initial Application Development (Claude)
Once the structure was finalized, Claude was used to build the foundational web application. This included implementing the core logic for:
* The timer system and rep-based exercise handling.
* Automatic progression between exercises and sets.
* The overall single-page application structure.

### 3. Visual Design Direction (Google Gemini)
To establish a clear design goal, Gemini was used to generate a detailed prompt describing the desired aesthetic: a **clean, minimalist, and distraction-free UI** focused on high clarity and usability during workouts.

### 4. UI Refinement (Google Stitch)
The prompt generated by Gemini was then utilized in Google Stitch, paired with a screenshot of an earlier UI version (generated by Claude) as a visual reference. This step allowed Stitch to:
* Refine the interface design.
* Ensure the visual style was consistent with the existing layout and the minimalist prompt.

### 5. Integration & Finalization
Finally, the refined UI code generated by Stitch was integrated back into the application logic using Claude. The current repository represents **Version 5 of the Circuit Workout Companion**, reflecting multiple rounds of iteration across planning, design, and implementation.
